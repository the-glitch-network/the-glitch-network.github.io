## Fonts

The font [`assets/vga437.woff`](assets/vga437.woff) was created using FontForge on a preexisting font called
`Perfect DOS VGA 437`, which seems to be derived from the IBM VGA 8x16 font.

Best effort to find licensing restrictions is that it is perfectly fine to use this font for this purpose,
given that it is non-commercial, and the creator of Perfect DOS VGA 437 has given permission for personal & commercial
use.
